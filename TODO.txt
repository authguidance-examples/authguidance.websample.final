TECHNICAL DETAILS SEQUENCE
--------------------------
1. Web Proxy API ./deploy.sh to deploy the API gateway
   This will enable test driven development to get OAuth work done

2. Get tests working for BFF
   This needs to get encryption working end-to-end
   Update to Michal's algorithm
   First use local HTTPS endpoint then test lambda workflow locally

3. Get SPA working locally against local BFF and gateway

DOCS
----
1. Add a README for SPA deployment scenarios in the delivery folder
   Rename deployment folder since it gets in the way of the deploy.sh script

2. Update blog posts ASAP

LATER
-----
1. Fix terminology around 'docker-deployed'
   Ensure that docker end-to-end still works

2. Run in Docker container by default, via API gateway
   Provide an option for running BFF API locally, for debugging

3. Final APIs to port 446
