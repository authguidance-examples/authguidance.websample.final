-------
1. ErrorHandler for proxy API responses to check similar details to business API
   Think about invalid_data errors and avoid the SPA getting stuck if aft does not match cookie???
   Default action should be to redirect if refresh fails

2. When logged out change the Home button text to Login

3. SPA blog updates
   Stick to current domain names to avoid out of control changes
   Review existing wording

4. Final API updates
   Update to port 445
   Keep blog updates minimal
   Think about 'npm start localapi' - change blog wording instead
