PART 1
------
1. Get basics working
   Error serialization problems - perhaps UIError could be improved?
   Verify headers not intercepted
   Get code nicely separated

2. Deploy and also test in mobile browsers

3. Mobile web refactoring and fix lint errors

PART 2

Error refactoring in SPA
   - handleHttpError in apiClient, which knows nothing about Axios
   - return UIError from worker, which is the only class that knows about Axios
   - reduce code in ErrorHandler.getFromHttpError

Merge to main

CSRF token to think more about, since the CDN should return this
Stored in memory by each browser tab in a private variable / closure
Otherwise it is easy for malicious code to abuse the cookie
