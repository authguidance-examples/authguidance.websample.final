1. Test in all browsers except mobile

2. Error refactoring in SPA
   - handleHttpError in apiClient
   - return UIError from worker, which knows about Axios
   - reduce code in ErrorHandler.getFromHttpError

3. Fix import statements

4. Concurrent API calls to check at a code level and to think about
   Hopefully works since it is still promises

5. Make authenticator use the worker also
   Ensure that access token stays in the worker

6. Deploy and also test in mobile browsers

7. CSRF token to think more about, since the CDN should return this???

8. Merge to main
