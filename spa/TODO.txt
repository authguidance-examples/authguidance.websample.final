1. Fix Safari problem and also test on iPad:
   - Refused to load https://web.authsamples.com/spa/dist/webWorkerChannel.bundle.worker.js because it
     appears in neither the child-src directive nor the default-src directive of the Content Security Policy.

2. Implement an OAuthFetch class to share OAuth fetch logic

3. Multi tab logout by watching local storage
   See React book for further details
