PHASE 1
-------
1. Handle an invalid scope redirect error
   Also handle storing location / data before and after redirect

2. ErrorHandler for proxy API responses to check similar details to business API
   Think about invalid_data errors and avoid the SPA getting stuck if aft does not match cookie???

PHASE 2
-------
1. Try a quick deployment of SPA from branch - where I can revert if needed
   Then deploy and merge

2. Verify that mobile web solution still works
   Also test Android and iOS, as a checkup

3. README updates
   - Separate API and Web concerns
   - Keep token options open
   - Productive developer setup

4. SPA blog updates
   Stick to current domain names to avoid out of control changes
   Review existing wording

5. Final API updates
   Update to port 445
   Keep blog updates minimal
   Think about 'npm start localapi' - change blog wording instead

PHASE 3
-------
1. Proxy API to validate id token and compare to at_hash
   After token refresh I may not get an id token so it will be optional

2. onLoggedOut to get working across tabs via a timer

3. Lambda edge
   configValidationMode to better understand
   Deprecation warning: Support for "package.include" and "package.exclude" will be removed with next major release. 
   Please use "package.patterns" instead

4. authsamples.local domain

5. When logged out change the Home button to Login and change text

6. Trim down the federated logins post so that I do not need idp config in samples
   Get rid of this but just mention acr_values
