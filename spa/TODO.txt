1. Error refactoring in SPA
   - handleHttpError in apiClient, which knows nothing about Axios
   - return UIError from worker, which is the only class that knows about Axios
   - reduce code in ErrorHandler.getFromHttpError

2. Make authenticator use the worker also
   Ensure that access token stays in the worker
   Updated relationship between apiClient and authenticator

3. Deploy and also test in mobile browsers

4. Merge to main

5. CSRF token to think more about, since the CDN should return this
   Otherwise it is easy for malicious code to get a token with a cookie
