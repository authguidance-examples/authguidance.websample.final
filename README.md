## Overview

The final demo SPA, which aims for a [Web Architecture](https://authguidance.com/web-architecture-goals/) with best capabilities:

- The SPA uses an API driven OpenID Connect solution via the **Token Handler Pattern**
- Only the most secure cookies are used, with no tokens in the browser
- Only client side React technology is needed to implement the SPA, for productive development
- The SPA is split into micro-UIs, to keep the web code base manageable as it grows
- The SPA is deployed to many global locations via a Content Delivery Network (CDN)

## Components

The SPA architecture looks like this, where OAuth related components are hosted in the AWS cloud.\
This ensures that local web development is focused only on the React SPA:

The shell application is used to manage login and logout to the whole web domain.\
The cookies issued are then used by the main React app, to call APIs.

## Views

The SPA is a simple UI with some basic navigation between views, which have a fictional investments theme.\
The data is returned from an API that authorizes access to resources using domain specific claims.

## Online System

The online version uses the AWS Cloudfront CDN to deliver static content to the browser.\
Login at https://web.authsamples.com/ with this AWS Cognito test account:

```text
- User: guestuser@mycompany.com
- Password: GuestPassword1
```

## Local Development Quick Start

Build code locally via this command, which runs `npm install` and `npm start`:

```bash
./build.sh
```

Custom development domains are used so you must add this DNS entry to your hosts file:

```bash
127.0.0.1 localhost web.authsamples-dev.com
```

Next configure [Browser SSL Trust](https://authguidance.com/2017/11/11/developer-ssl-setup#browser) for the SSL root certificate:

```
./certs/authsamples-dev.ca.pem
```

Then run this script in another terminal window to run a simple web host that serves static content.\
You can then edit the demo apps's React code and view updates, in a pure SPA manner.

```bash
./run.sh
```

When the browser is invoked at https://web.authsamples-dev.com/, sign in with the test account.\
You can then test all lifecycle operations, including expiry events, multi-tab browsing and multi-tab logout.

## Further Information

* Further architecture details are described starting in the [Final SPA Overview](https://authguidance.com/2019/04/07/local-ui-setup)
* See the [Backend for Frontend Design](https://authguidance.com/spa-back-end-for-front-end/) for details on the security design for URLs and cookies.

## Programming Languages

* TypeScript and React are used to implement the SPA

## Infrastructure

* AWS Route 53 is used for custom hosting domains
* AWS S3 is used as the upload point for web static content
* AWS Cloudfront is used to distribute web static content globally, for equal web performance
* AWS Certificate Manager is used to manage and auto renew the Web Host's SSL certificate
* AWS Cognito is used as the default Authorization Server
* AWS Serverless or Kubernetes API Hosting is used to host remote API endpoints used by the SPA
* Token handler components are used to implement API driven cookie issuing on behalf of the SPA
