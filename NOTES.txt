SECURITY
--------
1. Override JSON Service to refine the refresh_token_grant message

2. Refine local storage further - remove token keys from storage
   Restrict to just the needed protocol claims

3. Understand OIDC state storage better - in local storage
   Can I use session storage for this?
   Afterwards, test expiring refresh token on a different tab to the one that got it

SPA
---
1. Improve GitHub README of main web sample to indicate the proxy pattern being implemented
   Result is multi tab browsing with tokens in memory and standard use of CDN and API calls

2. Get rid of trailing backslash in redirect uri

3. Fix weird ReactJS logout effect of redirecting from #/loggedout to #loggedout to #/loggedout

FINALISE ONCE PAST ALL RISKS
----------------------------
1. Remove Web Static Content from .Net Core and Java APIs

2. Merge changes to master and redeploy main SPA

3. Test on Android and iOS browsers

4. Update blog instructions on how to run Final SPA and Final APIs

5. Design Articles to end SPA theme - and describe pattern
   Then describe Final SPA as part of Cloud theme
