SECURITY
--------
1. Use CSRF protection for token endpoint methods that receive a cookie

   https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/133787/securely-using-jwts-with-csrf-protection-and-refresh-tokens

2. Refine local storage further - remove token keys from storage
   Restrict to just the needed protocol claims

3. Understand OIDC state storage better - in local storage
   Can I use session storage for this?
   Afterwards, test expiring refresh token on a different tab to the one that got it

SPA
---
1. Get rid of trailing backslash in redirect uri

2. Fix weird ReactJS logout effect of redirecting from #/loggedout to #loggedout to #/loggedout   

FINALISE ONCE PAST ALL RISKS
----------------------------
1. Remove Web Static Content from .Net Core and Java APIs

2. Merge changes to master and redeploy main SPA

3. Test on Android and iOS browsers

4. Update blog instructions on how to run Final SPA and Final APIs

5. Design Articles to end SPA theme - and describe pattern
   Then describe Final SPA as part of Cloud theme
